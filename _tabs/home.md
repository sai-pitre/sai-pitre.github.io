## Welcome

I am a Fourth Year PhD Student in Economics at Brown University. My research interests are in the field of Development Economics, Labor Economics and Public Economics.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant and Pre-Doc at [J-PAL](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/)'s India office.
